What to do when a model file is too large for GitHub / Heroku? (BONUS):

  + Ask the person who created the model to "reduce dimensionality" so the model file will be smaller, may require prediction accuracy trade-offs
  + Store the model remotely:
    + https://aws.amazon.com/s3/
    + https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/brexitmeter-bucket/weights?authuser=1&project=brexitmeter
